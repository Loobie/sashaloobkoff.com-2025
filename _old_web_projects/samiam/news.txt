<b>fuuuugggggahhhhh!!!!!</b>
Why the malcontentment? Well, after 4-5 weekends of locking myself in my jack-office, I'm still not done with this fuggghh'n site. 

What a pain. 

Every 7-10 months I get these projects to make a website... and then I remember how much I fuggghhh'n hate making websites.

I urge you, don't make it a career... browsers hate you... computers hate you... code hates you...

... and nothing works the way you want it too. Well, eventually it does but jeeezzzz....

Just got done converting 3-4 years of news entries such that they will work in the new, flash based environs. T-e-d-i-o-u-s shit... I swear. I think I've gotten carpal-ized.

Shit, where's my <a href="http://www.brahma.com" target="_newWindow">Brahma</a>?

And to top of all off, Samiam's ISP has locked the gates and I can't post anything.

Fugh... at least I've caught up on some of my smoking and drinking.

<b>In other brighter news</b>, Samiam are off being rockstars in euro-land. Whoo-yoo. Keep the emails coming.

The west coast shows in october were a mixed bag. I went to the los angeles show at the Troubadour and, although a ton of people showed up, i thought it was kind of a bummer. I mean there was a lot of love in the room (people quitely nodding their heads and singing along) but sheeesh, no energy in the crowd at all. C'mon people. Samiam played an energetic, drunken set... where's the stage-diving? Where's the moshing? Why aren't you tearing the place apart?

Evidently the crowd at the Bottom of the Hill (SF) got it and had the decency to destroy everything in site. 

Hello? First U.S. show in 6 years?

The band was stoked to get such a great response in our hometown. 

BTW, somebody posted 2-3 songs from that gig on <a href="http://youtube.com/" target="_newWindow">youTube</a>, so check it out.

Oh, and the new video for "Storm Clouds" is up on the web <a href="http://www.medicineagency.com/" target="_newWindow">here</a>. John, the director, is a pretty frick'n creative dude... you can see some of his other work on the site.

See ya,<br><a href="mailto:sasha@sashaloobkoff.com">Sasha</a>

P.S.<br>Oh, I forgot to mention that I met the creator of "Sponge Bob Square Pants" (Stephen, I think his name was) at the Troubadour show... how cool is that? I wonder if he liked what he heard...

<b>Recording.</b>
Recording starts on May 1st in San Francisco...we have 17 songs... hope you like them, we do.

Also, a bunch of samiam videos are now up at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/samiam" target="_newWindow">mySpace</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/" target="_newWindow">youTube</a>.

We just found an mp3 of a song called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/samiam" target="_newWindow">"I Want More"</a> that jason and sergie wrote and haven't heard for about 12 years. It is amazing to hear something that has been totally forgotten for so long.

Anyways, it and one other song (that is still missing) was recorded at the time of 'Clumsy' in 1994, produced by Lou Giordano and played by Jason, James Brogan, Aaron Rubin, Victor Indrizzo and Sergie...but for whatever reason didn't make it onto the Clumsy album...nor onto any compilations or ep b-sides.

There is even an extra guitar bit played by Sean... four years before he joined the band!

We are pretty sure that no one that worked at Atlantic Records then is still with the company, so chances are that we won't be messed with for giving it away on mySpace...you can download 100 percent for free.

Please email anyone you know that enjoyed 'clumsy'... we would love to have everyone that likes that record to own this song.

See ya,<br><a href="mailto:sergie@sbcglobal.net">Sergie</a>

<b>More Practice.</b>
Things are moving along as the band has reconvened  for the 3rd time since november to practice and write new material.

Cool. Things are really looking different around here... with stuff actually going on and all. Sergie and I were even talking about re-designing gosamgo.com... it's been along time and this piece is looking awfully 1997.

In the meantime we thought it might  be time to start selling more stuff online. If you haven't already, check out our store <a href="http://www.momibello.com/frameset.php" target="_newWindow">here</a>.

But before we invest too much money into something nobody wants, we thought it might be a good idea check with you first. Below are the 2 vintage t-shirt designs we are bringing back. Please click on your preference... but only if you seriously think you'd order one.

<b>Editor's note:</b><br>it's been only one day and we have been deludged with votes. Now while that is a good thing, I know from experience that only a small percentage of voters will actually follow through. Again, please vote only if you seriously plan on ordering a shirt. They will prolly be $10 - $12 each (+ shipping). Much cheaper than what other bands sell there stuff for... but still a financial commitment.

Oh and now that I think about it, I suppose you could email us and <a href="mailto:info@momibello.com">pre-order</a> a different color. I'll prolly be going to the printer in a week or two.

<b>Hello.</b>
Hi, this is Sergie from the Samiams...you know, the guitar player?!?!?

Just wanted to inform you that the new Samiam bass player is Mr. Jeremy Bergo. We had a marathon practice spell in San Francisco and he was a great bass player... and a really nice guy to boot. I think he likes us too. As Sasha said, everyone is excited to be back to a 5-piece...and stop hearing Sean complain about how he wants to play guitar (just kidding...sort of.)

Anyways, I just started a Samiam mySpace page...so far we only have a single, solitary myspace buddy: Tom from mySpace. Can you go <a href="http://myspace.com/samiam" target="newWindow">here</a> and be our friend?

I mean, big bands like Avenged Sevenfold or Hawthorne Heights have, like, oh my god, half a million friends.

What does Samiam have? 

Tom.

We are setting our sights for May to record...we have tons of new songs...so be warned.

See ya,<br><a href="mailto:sergie@sbcglobal.net">Sergie</a>

<b>The band is practicing.</b>
I don't really have much to report other than the band convened in San Francisco on friday to practice and work on new tunes.

This time around bass duties will be handled by a new guy from Minnesota.

Cool, now the band is bi-costal and midwestern. Cripes... I don't even want to think about how much Samiam pay in airline fees.

Anyways, I for one look forward to hearing the band with Sean on guitar. Should be really great. Like I've said many times before, he's long been one of the best guitar players any of us have known.

Oh, and thanks to everyone that have sent pictures to the link below...it's really cool to see where our friends live and what they look like.

<b>Shows put off.</b>
<a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/jason_ouchie/jason.swf" target="_newWindow"><img src="jason_ouchie/1.jpg" border="0"></a>

Unfortunately, friday's deadline for the promoter in Canada to present working papers, plane tickets and hotel confirmations weren't met, so we followed the Canadian band Choke's decision to bow out of the Polar Fest (for the same reasons). We were looking forward to playing Montreal again, but no one would travel that far with so much up in the air.

All this is academic anyway as friday, Jason, our singer, had his nose broken and reset...don't laugh, but he is currently in a face cast.

Click on Jason's head to examine the damage yourself...

We also had to cancel Janelle's party in San Francisco on thursday... no singer means no shows.

<b>New Samiam and Solea CDs by Summer!?!</b>
Although the debut Solea album has been out in japan, europe and the UK for over a year, this week marks the release of it here in the US. If you have trouble finding it in stores (it is on a small label, <a href="http://www.textbookmusic.com" target="_newWindow">Textbook Music</a>, please order from the band directly <a href="http://www.momibello.com" target="_newWindow">here</a>.

They are currently are working on the follow up that will be out sometime next year.

Read below for the good news concerning Samiam.

<b>They never went away.</b>

And now they're back.
Samiam is hunkering down with a squall of new songs which they'll be rehearsing next month in San Francisco. Jason, Sergie, Sean and Johnny all down in the basement with nothing to protect them but a twelve pack of budweiser and their chosen instruments.

Everyone is stoked!

Look for a release next summer, followed by some touring.

<b>New image galleries.</b>
With Solea recording a new cd, there isn't much news in the world   of Samiam. But by now we're used to that, aren't we?

Fortunately we have two new batches of photos to show you from the bands hugely successful march tour of europe. Please make sure you turn off your pop-up blockers for this site or the galleries won't work.

Enjoy.

<b>Samiam on tour.</b>

Check out the <a href="tourdates.htm">Shows</a> section for specific dates and locations.

We finally got the site back up. There was so much interest concerning the band's european tour that the site simply blew up. Typical bandwidth issues... welcome back.

Do me a favor and leave a message on the board... ok?

<b>Samiam is back.</b>
I've been hinting about it for a couple of months now in the messeage board and now that the dates are confirmedI can finally post it here.

Samiam is going on a tour.

Cool. So it is true.

Samiam get back together once a year to tour a far away land. This time it's Europe. Big surprise. What is this? Their 12th european tour?

Actually, I think it is.

You american and canadian fans must be pissed. When was the  last "local" show anyways? 2000?

If it's any consolation, I haven't seen them play in ages. And I'm related to the band. Hell, I even played guitar for them once.

Anyways, check out the shows section for specific dates and locations.</a>

<b>Solea in Europe.</b>
You saw the dates on the opening page, now make your plans. Should be an incredible show.

We've been selling Solea's debut CD in amaing numbers from our <a href="http://www.momibello.com" target="_newWindow">webstore</a>. So much so that it's been hard to keep them in stock.

Do yourself a favor and order a copy today.

<b>Buy Solea's debut CD.</b>
Anybody who thinks they will want to order a japanese copy of solea's full length please eMail <a href="mailto:sasha@sashaloobkoff.com">me</a>.

I'm in the proccess of placing my first order with bad news (the  record label) and it's turning into a minor hassle (due to no fault of theirs... they're totally cool). Don't ask... suffice to say i want to make as few orders as i have to. But first i need to gauge the demand.

Keep in mind that the japanese version will have two bonus tracks that won't be on the u.k., euro or american discs. ("even stranger days" and "night and day").

Sorry for the hard sell.

Obviously the eMail won't be a binding commitment so don't sweat it. I'm predicting the price will be about $16 plus shipping. Yea, i know that's expensive but it's still $9 cheaper than any western retailer we've found.

In the meantime, feel free to shop at my new <a href="http://www.momibello.com"  target="_newWindow">online record store</a>. inventory is limited at the moment, but i'm working on it!!!

We're using paypal to proccess all orders.

thanks for the support!<br>-<a href="mailto:sasha@sashaloobkoff.com">Sasha</a>

No Samiam news. What's new? Photos of Solea's japanese tour can be seen <a href="http://www.sashaloobkoff.com/japan" target="newWindow">here</a>. 

I realize nobody (including me) has looked at the Messageboard ever since some creep messed it up with his/her porno psuedo-hacking script.

<b>Solea in Japan.</b>

<a href="http://www.solea.org" target="newWindow"><img src="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/soleaticket.gif"></a>

Solea is busy rehearsing in Los Angeles this week in preparation  for their second Japanese tour in a year. This is by far the tightest line up the band has had especially with the addition of Scott (Sensefield, Elliott Smith) on drums. Our flight departs on Saturday.. we're totally jazzed.

<b>EuroTour Goes Off.</b>
But like the dork I am, I deleted all the details. What a pain.

Suffice to say the tour was a huge success. Well, other than the fact that both of Sergie's guitars were stolen in Trier. If anyone spots two brown Gibson SGs on ebay (or in German guitar shops) that mention something about Samiam, 

please contact <a href="mailto:sergie@slappedtogether.com">us</a>. 

The whole thing stinks.

We also have this Tour Poll question up but who knows how accurate it is. Ballot stuffers suck. I suppose I could regulate how many times people vote by including cookies but that really goes against the spirit of the site. I don't want to do that.

Anyways, I have no idea what Samiam are doing next. Sergie is busy recording  an album with Solea so I figure we won't hear too much from Samiam  until some cool tour offers come in.

Until then, check out some new pictures the <a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/photos_brazil.htm">PHOTOS</a> section of the site [6 more added 8/26]. Also, check out the Samiam community at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/gosamgo" target="_blank">livejournal.com</a>.

<b>Old drummer report:</b>
Mark (Samiam's original drummer) is starting a new project in the bay area by the name of <b>Tijuana Bible</b>. The band is currently wrapping up a 4-song demo and should be playing out soon.

I think Mark said something about a guy from the old hardcore band Grimple being in the band but their sound is more Guns and Roses-ish than thrash. All right!

Meanwhile M.P. is making the big bucks drum-teching for Dashboard Confessional and Davey is playing with Earlimart (a band I hear quite a bit about these days). Both Scott McPherson and Dave Ayers have checked in recently but I don't think either has a fulltime gig right now.

<b>More Dates Posted.</b>
Five more dates and two more countries have been added to the <a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/tourdates.htm" target="center">summer tour</a>. Yipee!

Unfortunately, no other tours are currently planned so everyone from the U.K., Australia, Sweden, Japan, Canada and the U.S. who have been baraging me with email can officially stop.

For now the only way to see Samiam live is to book an european vacation.

Sorry.

<b>Solea</b> also have a ton of stuff going on.

They just returned from a week of rockstar madness in Japan with a new drummer and bass player. I got a ton of photos and info to add to their <a href="http://www.solea.org" target="newWindow">site</a> so keep your eyes peeled.

Oh, and the people at Suzuki apparently weren't too impressed with the artwork on Solea's new ep, "Even Stranger." Ever hear the words "cease and desist?"

Sergie already designed a new cover which will be up on the site shortly.

<b>Tour Dates Posted.</b>

So cruise on over to the "Shows" section of the site for info.

<a href=" "><img class="right" src="http://www.gosamgo.com/samSALEbanner.jpg"></a>Sergie is selling all his extra samiam and solea cds, eps, lps and 7's  on <a href="" target="newWindow">ebay.com</a>... with no reserve!!! He wants them to have good homes, so if not many people bid, you can have them for really cheap. If you want he will sign them too. Lots of stuff is first pressing and really rare, have a look.The message board is back up, so start posting.

<b>The quiz</b>.I've made some modifications to the <a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/quiz/quiz.php" target="center">quiz</a> including adding 6 more questions. It seems as though only about half of you could get the thing working before so I made it easy for everyone. Please email <a href="mailto:sloobkof@sashaloobkoff.com">me</a> if you have any problems. I doubt anyone will.

It's a pretty hard quiz. Part of the reason I made the quiz was to "publish" little know facts about Samiam. It wouldn't be interesting if it was easy. I also wanted to compile an email list for the band, so be forewarned that you will be asked for your email address. Don't worry, we won't inundate you with junk mail or give out our list (who would want it anyways?). At most you'll get is a couple of text only messages a year detailing Sam-events.

Good luck!!!

<b>Summer Tour</b>
Just when you thought all hope was lost, Samiam have risen from their slumber... this time for a July European tour. More details to follow...  

The site on the other hand, is still sleeping. Sorry, but we moved servers and I have been too busy to fix everything that needs to be fixed. That will soon change, I promise. In the mean time the quiz is down as is the message board. Look for new and improved versions in the not too distant future...

<b>Back from Brazil.</b>
Samiam are back home from their hugely successfull Brazillian tour and we have <a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/photos_brazil.htm"  target="center">photos</a>!

A big thank you to Cesar, Alexandre, Marlisi, Jose, Antionio, Francesco and everyone that sent me their shots!

<a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/photos_brazil.htm" target="center"><img src="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/brazil.jpg" align="right" border="0"></a> But before you check out the photos, read Sean's Brazillian Tour diary in the "History" section of the site!

Sean also sent me the url of his new band: <a href="http://www.thefakers.net" target="newWindow">The Fakers</a>. I heard a demo a couple months ago and it was really good.

Sean sings and plays guitar.

Earlier I suggested that Jason might've jammed with The Fakers a couple  of times on a recent NYC visit. I was wrong. Sean and Jason did work on some songs, but they were Samiam songs. Can't wait to hear some new stuff (by both bands).

<b>Anybody like The Vines?</b>
I thought I did based on their single (which rocks) but I bought the cd and it's pretty disappointing. Not terrible or anything but not great either. Anyways, the only reason I bring it up is that VIc (Samiam's Clumsy-era drummer) played drums on one of the songs on the album. The man gets around.

Smitty wrote in to tell us that Samiam came in #8 in the new <a href="http://www.blanktv.com/home/home.php4" target="newWindow">BlankTV</a> top ten list. Right on. If you have a speedy connection, check out some videos!

<b>Brazil!</b>
As you may have heard, Samiam is heading to Brazil next month. Everyone is stoked!

Check out the "Tour Dates" section for details. [Updated 8/25]
In other news, <a href="http://www.solea.org" target="newWindow">solea</a> are gearing up to record their debut cd. Their new songs sound great!

<b>A New Song!</b><br><a href="http://www.hopelessrecords.com/store.php" target="newWindow"><img class="right" src="http://www.gosamgo.com/HopelessComp/hopeless.gif" border="0" align="right"></a>Well, it ain't so new... but 
it's previously unreleased. Hopeless Record's new comp, "Hopelessly Devoted to You, Vol. 4," features a song from the "Astray" sessions entitled "Look No Hand." Great song, I think it should have made the cd. It would've been one of my favorites.

Click <a href="http://www.gosamgo.com/HopelessComp/Samiam.mp3">here</a> for a 30 sec mp3 sample.

<a href="www.hopeless.com" target="newWindow">Pre-order</a> the cd from Hopeless for only $2.

Not bad. Also featured are tracks by Thrice, Common Rider, The Weakerthans and the usual cast of Hopeless characters. Oh, and if your copy contains the winning ticket, you win a free Dell computer. Yippeee.

From what I hear, the shows in May went well. I got a million emails from people wanting to get on the guest list for the SF show, so I know people were excited. Unfortunately, Samiam were added to the bill after the show was sold out so few Samiam fans actually got in. Sergie got plastered and tore up the club... so all is well.

No more shows are booked at the moment, so please save your emails.

As you can see the website is back up. We switched servers a while back and had a bunch of problems. Now that it is up, we promise to devote the site to Samiam and remove most of the information concerning Solea (Sergie and Johnny's new band). We recieved some messages from people bummed that the news was mostly devoted to Solea and not Samiam...fair enough, now you can go to <a href="http://www.solea.org" target="newWindow">www.solea.org</a> for updates on that band (including tour dates).

In the 'way to go bro' dept.: Jealous Sound has picked up Get Up Kids dates on the west coast, Sensefield rocked nationwide on Jay Leno, Texas is the Reason (rip) scored a small fortune from Mercedes Benz (or was it BMW?) by being on German TV spots and the new Promise Ring cd is really great!

<A href="http://home.earthlink.net/~sloobkof/CutlassSupreme/" target="newWindow"><img src="http://www.gosamgo.com/Cutlass.gif" align="left"></a>Click <A href="http://home.earthlink.net/~sloobkof/CutlassSupreme/" target="newWindow">here</a> to download a <b>Cutlass Supreme</b> MP3 (or purchase their new CD) from their web site.

<b>In Other News:</b>
<img src="http://www.gosamgo.com/_old/Lil_Punker_Jimi.gif">I  recently finished a web site for James' (ex-Samiam) new company, <a href="http://www.primedentertainment.com" target="newWindow">Primed Entertainment</a>.

They're into music management and consulting, so if you're in a band that needs representation, you  know where to go.

Oh yea, and James also wrote a book. After countless Social Unrest and Samiam tours (with bands like Bad Religion, The Toadies, The Supersuckers, Blink 182, Error Type 11, Millencollin, Unwritten Law, All, The Bloodhound Gang, Creed (blech...) and Green Day), it's time someone put it all down on paper. Think of the debauchery! Think of the wacky hi-jinks! Plus, James is a master story teller...ya know what I'm Satan? The title is:<b>"TOUR STORIES and Other 3rd Grade Tales."</b> James will be hocking copies by mail. You can get ordering info <a href="mailto:info@primedentertainment.com">here</a>. 

<b>Ex drummer report:</b><br>We ran into M.P at the bar he manages in L.A. (Good Luck bar - Hollywood/Sunset). Cool bar. Turns out he's playing in a lounge act named Champagne Velvet that recently opened for Hank Williams Jr III at the Roxy. Right on. Scott has been playing in Elliott Smith's band; Vic with Beck, Scott Weiland and now Macy Gray; and Mark, I think, is in the Working Stiffs. I'm not sure if Dave is in a band but I know he's giving drum lessons in SF.
