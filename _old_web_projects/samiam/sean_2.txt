sean_2=<html><body><b>The weeed in Brazil sucks.</b>
You'd think in a country with so much equatorial sunlight they'd be able to grow some decent shit, but instead it's all this brown compacted skank, devoid of dankness (the natives in Garage Fuzz told me it's all brought over from Uruguay on the backs of tapirs or something). The  good thing about it is you can smoke joints all day and not be completely  useless by the time you're supposed to rock the bells. None of this concerns me that much, though, because I'm not a heavy pot-smoker. I just puffed a  little here and there, pleasantly passing the time.

<b>BRAZIL 2002: </b>
<img src="seanBrazil.jpg">Oh, the tour, it was so great, man. I don't know where to  begin, so let me start at the end: After the last show, Jason and I enlisted  three 18-year-old gluesniffinâ girls to find us some coke. We got in a cab  and they took us to this row of brothels. The boldest of the sniffer-girls got out and approached the most naked of the street prostitutes (she was  wearing a thong, a fish-net dress that concealed nothing, and a pair of  4-inch clear lucite heels) and said something to her in Portuguese, then turned around and asked me how much we wanted. I handed her a 50 reis bill  (about $15 US) which she gave to the hooker, who went next door to a little cafe/bar. Jason, who was already pleasantly loaded, had wandered into the cafe and ordered a cappuccino or something. The nearly-naked lady came back  and put five fat sacks of coke in my palm and then walked off. I felt  nervous about having drugs and money on me standing in front of a gaggle of  hookers in Brazil, so I started getting back in the cab, when I saw Jason  still standing at the counter of the cafe. I think I heard him asking the  girl next to him "How do you say 'extra foama?'" Envisioning my life in a  Brazilian jail, I yelled at him "Fuck the coffee, just get in the cab!" He  looked at me confusedly and said "But I already ordered it!" Once we were in  the cab, though, we just began laughing. Back at the hotel, Johnny was  puking all over from drinking too much caiperenia, and he took literally a  two-hour shower - his longest, as far as anyone can remember. We all thought  he was dead and were beginning to divide up his stuff when we heard groans  coming from the bathroom. Suddenly, he came out all clean and did a rail of  toots as wide as the Amazon.

I don't know, a bunch of other stuff happened, too, at other times. The tour  was great, overall, lots of love flowing, plenty of alcohol and no big  problems. Cigarettes are only 70 cents a pack! People kept asking me if I'd  really slept with Cindy Crawford (read below), and I was all "Cindy who? It's 2002! I'm  all about Grahama Cracker, now - in her time of need!" And the shows, yeah,  they were amazing - the fans seemed to know all the songs, screamed out the  words and were really tolerant of our indulgences. We actually played nearly sober occasionally out of gratitude (or maybe by accident). [editor's note to sXe-ers: that's sarcasm] Thanks (hic) Brasil!

Truth,
Sean
