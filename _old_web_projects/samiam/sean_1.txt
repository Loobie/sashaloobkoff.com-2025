<b>Welcome to my world</b>
<img src="sean.jpg">I initially wanted to sit down and write some kind of honest explanation, some outpouring of my true feelings, but then I thought that's bullshit. You can't get blood from a stone, and I really don't buy into that honesty crap, you know what I mean? It just isn't me. I don't have genuine "feelings" to relate.

Whatever.

I'm in a dilemma now, though. As a bi-coastal rock semi-star, I travel often between NY (my home) and SF (my band). In my frequent travels, I see a lot of domestic animals, and I can't help but feel lacking, that I don't have a cute little beast to take care of, to keep me warm at night, to force to conform to a will beyond its comprehension. Of course, I would like to bring one with me as I flit from East to West and back, and this would dovetail nicely with my natural inclination towards small, furry things. But which breed so I get? In Frisco, the Chihuahua reigns supreme. It's difficult to walk down the street of a sunny Sunday afternoon and not step on one of these cute bug-eyed little buggers. They're naturally nervous (like me), and look like a cross between an insect and a real dog. In New York, however, the French Bulldog has ascended to the top of the dogpile. They look more like overfed bats than dogs, and I think they give them away with a Prada purchase.

Jason says I could resolve some of this coastal tension (listen up, rappers!) by cross-breeding the two (some neutral zone like Nebraska), resulting in a Frehuahua or a Chibullu, depending on which end gets the upper hand. A pup for any coast.

Sure, I've thought about getting something more original, like the aptly named Shitzu or the Pug, but I really want to conform via my pet, so people will think I have feelings and normal rock-star ambitions. It's difficult now for me to walk down the street and be recognized, as I dress more like Mr. Rogers than the rock hedonist inside. I figure a glamorous little fur muffin with legs will compensate for the lack of respect and props I now command from common pedestrians.

Sorry about all this. Sorry there isn't more heartfelt communication in this little self-glorifying blurb. I'm just incapable of expressing honesty or sincerity except to manipulate people.

You all seem really nice. I hope you like the new record OK. We had a lot of fun recording it. Maybe I'll see you on tour. I'll be the one pretending to play bass.

<b>Oh, if you want to hear the story of my early days in the band (circa 1998), read on...</b>
I joined Samiam in 1998, right before our five-month long tour of Japan and the US. I had given up on playing music; all hope seemed lost. Sergie and I were having a two-guy slumber party at his house, chasing his dog Cosmo around the house until well past midnight for some reason, having a clenched-jaw nowhere conversation about which physical body parts we find attractive, with respective analyses of various possible shapes of the aforementioned parts, in excruciating detail, staring at the ceiling hashing out the particulars until well into the dawn. We were moments away from an all-inclusive theory of the ideal body when Aaron callously interrupted us with a phone call and curtly quit the band. I immediately offered my services. As a secret test, Sergie asked me if I could figure out a Rammstein song ("Der Meister" from <i>Herzeleid</i>), which I barely passed and then got the job! Only one month lay between that moment and our first show of the tour, opening for Green Day in Japan, which meant a lot of practicing and learning songs. But at the moment, Sergie and I were so stoked that we blew it all off and went to Denny's for breakfast right then!

Later, I went to sleep. Then I quit my job at Rolling Stone, jumped on a plane, fell asleep again (during <i>Airbud</i>) and then all of the sudden there were all these short people blabbering gibberish at us! We were in Japan. They put tangerine slices on their pizzas. What are they thinking? They make great trinkets and toys, though, like cat-butt lighters and realistic-looking handguns that shoot plastic pellets that make real welts.

But let me start at the beginning. I met Sergie in college when we were randomly thrown together as roommates. After an initial period of mutual distrust, we became close friends. We wasted a thousand hours sitting on the steps of Sproul Plaza waiting for our "beaks" to walk by. (A beak is someone you don't know who you have a crush on. Neither of us ever met any of our beaks.)

Then, in '92, I got to go on tour with Samiam in Europe (when James couldn't make it), which was an awesome, sloshy, beer-fueled time. I probably drank 100 beers. Plus, they have hash in bars in Amsterdam. I'm not really big on getting stoned, but I got really stoned. I didn't have sex with any prostitutes, though. Not that I'm a puritan or a wuss; I would have done it if someone had dared me. I just didn't feel like it. They look like fish in fishbowls. Sex fish. Maybe if we were out in the open, like in a big field of tulips that stretched out beneath one of those big Dutch windmills, then I for sure would have torn the chintzy neglige off some prostitute and ravished her. Stoned out of our minds, mud and crushed flowers all around, love flowing between us.

Anyway, several years passed, I had two other bands: Sluggo and Ponyride, both of which collapsed due to internal weaknesses. Sergie actually played drums with Ponyride early on, before Samiam called him away. When Ponyride broke up, I figured it wasn't really in the cards for me to play music, so I was going to try to be a writer. I spent a lot of time looking at blank pieces of paper, not a thought in my head. But then Samiam saved my life! Or at least postponed it.

"Hey, that's great Sean, but who are you really? I want to know." I grew up in Boulder, Colorado and Houston, Texas. Later, I moved to California. I like to read a lot and occasionally magazines publish articles I write. My eyes are brown. I play bass. I use a crappy Mexican Fender P-bass because it sounds good and it was so cheap I don't care if I break it.

<b>Turn-ons:</b>
Teletubbies, daffodils, stalkers and ladybugs.

<b>Turn-offs:</b>
Spectra-vision, Bruce Willis, cow-shit and diet Coke. Also, Keith Harring. And Cindy Crawford -- what a conceited twit! Did you see her on <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>? She actually thinks that what she does is "Art" that will transcend the time it takes to throw away whatever glamour-puss rag she's in (<i>Playboy</i> this month). The air must get pretty thin around 6'. James: "Nah." Sergie: "She's got a rockin' ass." Sean: "Yeah, I must admit, the butt is persuasive." Seriously, though, I had sex with Cindy Crawford once and she's not even that good! She just lies there like a drowning victim waiting for you to pump the life back into her. It's more fun to have sex with a photograph of her, for too many reasons to list here. I've had better sex with dead animals, etc., etc.
