Today's existing timeline can be shifted by many different types of interactions.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, celestial events, or Earthly occurrences, such as a meteor crashing through the atmosphere, can cause a ripple or variance in the time continuum. 

A secret organization called Congressus monitors this timeline.  At the moment there is a change in history, they take action to repair it.

Joey Thompson, a fourteen-year-old girl from Massachusetts stumbles across an Amulet in her Aunt's apothecary.  When she touches it, The Amulet magically comes to life glowing brightly and turning slowly, until it locks in place.  Joey steals the necklace and is suddenly swept into the past where the adventure begins.

This new fantasy adventure series is fun, mystical, romantic and educational.  <b>THE AMULET CHRONICLES</b> follows Joey and her sixteen-year-old partner Peter as they explore various historical periods and events such as:  The Underground Railroad, Pre-Elizabethan England, Ancient Rome, the Beginning of the Atomic Era, and many more.  Through all these adventures Joey and a rich cast of characters, thrust against exotic backdrops and historical periods, learn that people and problems of the past are not so different from the present.  With strong relatable heroes, it is a coming of age tale that kids will love.
