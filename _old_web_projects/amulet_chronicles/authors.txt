<b>L.S. Tibbets</b> is a former television writer with credits on such shows as The Zach Files on ABC Family and Strange Days at Blake Holsey High on NBC's Discovery Kids.  Born Lorianne Snodgrass (no, that's not a typo) in Kettering, Ohio Lorianne grew up in middle class America with a love of reading and an obsession with Science Fiction and Fantasy that can betraced back to when the first Robotech cartoons aired in the U.S. in the mid-1980s.  With a B.A. in Theater Arts from California State University, Fullerton, Lorianne is able to quote most, if not all Star Wars movies verbatim and discuss The Dark Elf series by R.A. Salvatore in detail.  She often daydreams of fighting along side Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings, swears Picard was a better Captain than Kirk, and is also an avid World of Warcraft player. Nostalgic to the core, Lorianne engages in the lost art of needlepoint and crochet, plays the violin like two generations before her, and raises her two rambunctious daughters along with her adorable husband, Daniel, in the Los Angeles area.
