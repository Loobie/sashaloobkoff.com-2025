    <div class="slidingDiv">
        <ul>
            <li>I only drove the vehicle on the weekends and thus put very, very few miles on it. Mainly to the beach for surfing. :  )</li>
            
            <li>The engine is a chevy small block. I simply am not savvy enough to know exactly what size. runs very strong and idles smoothly. Has a lot of power!!!</li>
            
            <li>I have been informed that the transmission is stock. clutch and master cylinder have both been replaced in the last 2-3 years. Sometimes getting into first you may hear a little grinding (if you  don't put the clutch down far enough) but I have been assured this is normal for cars of this vintage. Again I would say this area is strong.</li>
            
            <li>The exhaust system is about 2 years old BUT the vehicle does emit its share of exhaust. 3 different mechanics have assured me this is common with vehicles of this vintage. My other car is a prius... it seems as though I may be a bit more sensitive than your typical gearhead. I've researched the matter a bit and found that insulating the floor board and extending the tail pipes would be inexpensive ways to improve air quality.</li>
            
            <li>The FJ40 has no major fluid leaks.</li>
            
            <li>5 tires with 98% tread left. All with stock wheels and hub caps. Very clean.</li>
            
            <li>Breaks are stong as new pads as well as resurfaced drums were one of my 1st repairs. To be honest, that work was done 3-4 years ago but very, very little milage ensued.</li>
            
            <li>AM/FM cassette deck with 6"(?) crummy speakers. works well but definately not high end. There is an amp in the glove that may or not work but it is not attached. Also, there is a cb antenna on the vehicle.</li>
            
            <li>The truck was rewired and labelled by an FJ40 expert electrician who, coincidently, has ties to the Peterson Auto Museum. I believe it cost me $1,200 and my dad, who is a gearhead living far away told me I was crazy to spend so much money. My wallets loss is the next owners gain. Only thing that doesn't work is horn.</li>
            
            <li>While there are no major rust holes... there is consistent rust starting to appear. I believe that it is very manageable. The trickiest part will prolly be the rain gutters on the top and, I suppose, the engine compartment.</li>
            
            <li>There seems to be some bondo work on the front 2 fenders and in spots the previous owner used a roller to paint. Also the hood has some dents but that is expect in a 39 year old car. For the most part it is pretty darn "straight."</li>
            
            <li>The interior is rugged but in pretty damn good condition. The new seat covers are a dream... they look almost mint. The 4x4 lever knob is the only knob missing. The back of the cab is open and lined with a durable yet partially removed (%10-15) astroturf carpet.</li>
        </ul>
