<b>www.sashaloobkoff.com/japan - a review.
i recently, at the behest of the artist, reviewed the newest work from sasha loobkoff.
/japan is a stuning departure from his earlier work. he's crafted a far more personal work that almost makes one think he's grown out the omnipreset layer of self-promotion that has shadowed his earlier work.
additionally, the soundtrack for this work is far superior to anything we've seen from loobkoff, although i think a significant portion of his fanbase will be wondering why there isn't more metal.
clearly, a very personal departure from his ealier work (although perhaps foreshadowed in his cult fave "the 2001 pg and e comfort home/energy star campaign").</b><br />ernest belding<br />starbucks<br /><u><a href='mailto:earnest@rangers.org'>earnest@rangers.org</a><br /></u>saturday, may 08, 2004 02:06:58 pm (pdt)<br /><br />
