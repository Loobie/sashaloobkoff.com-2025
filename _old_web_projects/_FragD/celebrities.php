				<p class="subhead">Celebrities / Guest List</p>
				<p class="body">Many celebrities and stars are fanatical and accomplished gamers. Yet surprisingly, very few venues cater to bring this huge activity into a social environment away from the couch and into a fun social environment.</p>
				<p class="body">A proven means of gaining massive media exposure is being missed… we intend to fix that!</p>
				<p class="body">There are many tournaments and product drops but very little grown-up out-of-home social experience… draw back the curtains and bring gamers together...</p>
				<p class="body" style="font-size: 16px; color: red;"><strong><i>...a place to meet up and hook up!</i></strong></p>
				<p class="body">The nights will be a mixture of pro-gamers, celebrity gamers, and upscale tech savvy enthusiasts that want to experience a unique social experience with friends both physically present and connected via the Xbox Live platform.</p>
