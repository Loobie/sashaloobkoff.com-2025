              Morbid obesity, also referred to as clinically severe obesity or 
              extreme obesity, is a chronic disease that afflicts approximately 
              9 million adult Americans. More than a matter of carrying extra 
              weight, severe obesity (a BMI of over 40&#8212;see BMI Chart) is 
              a chronic and debilitating disease, and this condition puts you 
              at very high risk for a host of serious medical problems. Weight 
              loss surgery is the only proven method of achieving long-term weight 
              control for the morbidly obese, and it is also effective in eliminating 
              or improving the co-morbidity factors associated with the disease.</p>

										for short periods during the night. The risk for sleep 
										apnea is higher for people who are overweight. A person 
										who is overweight may have more fat stored around his 
										or her neck. This may make the airway smaller. A smaller 
										airway can make breathing difficult, loud (snoring), or 
										stop altogether.</td>
