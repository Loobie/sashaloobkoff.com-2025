			  		<p>We are delighted you have inquired about 
				  our program at the Center for Surgical Weight Control at Garden 
				  Grove Hospital and we look forward to providing you with excellent 
				  care. We have provided a brief outline of the steps you will take 
				  on your journey. We encourage you to review the following information 
				  and let us know how we can be of service to you as you prepare to 
				  make one of the most important life decisions to better your health. 
				  We are dedicated to serving your needs so please don&#8217;t hesitate 
				  to call us should you require additional information. </p>

				  the center, we have found that it is helpful to interact with other 
				  potential candidates for surgery in a supportive environment so 
				  that we can provide detailed information to help you make an educated 
				  decision. We provide free seminars every month to give potential 
				  patients a chance to gain knowledge about the surgery and to provide 
				  an opportunity to ask questions of our surgeon. Some of the topics 
				  discussed include anatomy and physiology changes, risks and benefits 
				  of obesity surgery and nutrition. Necessary lifestyle changes associated 
				  with surgery and the maintenance of weight-loss are also outlined. 
				</p>
				<p><img src="art/journey_head_2" border="0"><br />Immediately following the lectures, we can arrange a brief, private consultation with our surgeon to give you an opportunity to discuss any specific questions you may have.</p>
